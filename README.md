# No more Mine in Hell
Minecraft mod

The mod based on George A. Romero's artistic work of Living Dead series aka the "Dead Series".
It reflects to and uses basic rules of the world of original movies and the remakes as well.
There will be some inevitable similarity with other products (without the need for completeness: Dead Island, State of Decay, Seven Days to Die games, other movies like Zombieland or TWD) due of inspiration effect of Romero's work. Other similarities coming from logical and basic consequence of applying rules and dramaturgy of an imagined zombie-cataclismatic world.
 
The III act are going through the main story line of Night of the Living Dead - Dawn of the Dead - Days of the Dead.

The mod's focus mainly on survival, therefore resource gathering is significant, while crafting has lower priority and mining has the lowest.

_Planned: Act IV. (Land of the Dead) and Act V. (Diary of the Dead). Maybe the Survival of the Dead could be an epilogue?_
