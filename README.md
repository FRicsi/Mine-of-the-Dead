## No more Mine in Hell

<b>Minecraft mod</b>

The mod based on George A. Romero's artistic work of Living Dead series aka the "Dead Series".
It reflects to and uses basic rules of the world of original movies and the remakes as well. Main concept of the mod is to survive a zombie pandemic outbreak, defend yourself while keep focus on the actual goal of the act 1-3. You'll have some weapons, tools and the skill of crafting some items, but basically not much. The world have had its economy that collapsed now, and missing many things to let you craft essential things (like guns). However, you can fix almost everything.
There was electricity, hot water, working cars and factories, gas stations and offices - now its all gone due of dead staff.
Dead, but not as dead as could be acceptable - they are reanimated corpses now hungry for living's brain. Yeah, your's as well.
Wandering in hordes, hunting for prey, they're too many. Fighting is not a clever option, running away and hiding could be better. Or couldn't?
It is up to you. Maybe hiding better while you are on your own, but what will you do, when you have survivors on your side? You are normal citizen just like others, and you have to defend them - or better became a lone wolf sacrificing others to survive everything? This mod also focusing these moral decisions as well in Romero's sarcastic end-world.

There will be some inevitable similarity with other products (without the need for completeness: <i>Dead Island, State of Decay, Seven Days to Die</i> games, other movies like <i>Zombieland or TWD</i>) due of inspiration effect of Romero's work. Other similarities coming from logical and basic consequence of applying rules and dramaturgy of an imagined zombie-cataclismatic world.
 
The three act are going through the main story line of Night of the Living Dead - Dawn of the Dead - Days of the Dead.


The mod's focus mainly on survival, therefore resource gathering is significant, while crafting has lower priority and mining has the lowest. Motto is "Use what you find and make it better with duct tape."
