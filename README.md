## No more Mine in Hell
<b><u>Minecraft mod</u></b>

The mod based on George A. Romero's artistic work of Living Dead series aka the "Dead Series".
It reflects to and uses basic rules of the world of original movies and the remakes as well. Main concept of the mod is to survive a zombie pandemic outbreak, defend yourself while keep focus on the actual goal of the act 1-3. You'll have some weapons, tools and the skill of crafting some items, but basically not much. The world have had its economy that collapsed now, and missing many things to let you craft essential things (like guns). However, you can fix almost everything.
There was electricity, hot water, working cars and factories, gas stations and offices - now its all gone due of dead staff.
Dead, but not as dead as could be acceptable - they are reanimated corpses now hungry for living's brain. Yeah, your's as well.
Wandering in hordes, hunting for prey, they're too many. Fighting is not a clever option, running away and hiding could be better. Or couldn't?
It is up to you. Maybe hiding better while you are on your own, but what will you do, when you have survivors on your side? You are normal citizen just like others, and you have to defend them - or better became a lone wolf sacrificing others to survive everything? This mod also focusing these moral decisions as well in Romero's sarcastic end-world.

There will be some inevitable similarity with other products (without the need for completeness: <i>Dead Island, State of Decay, Seven Days to Die</i> games, other movies like <i>Zombieland or TWD</i>) due of inspiration effect of Romero's work. Other similarities coming from logical and basic consequence of applying rules and dramaturgy of an imagined zombie-cataclismatic world.
 
The three act are going through the main story line of Night of the Living Dead - Dawn of the Dead - Days of the Dead.

<u>I. "Zombies...are...coming" - Night of the Living Dead</u>
First act is simply the outbreak. The'yre coming from everywhere, they won't stop, they want to eat flesh. The world just collapsed, you have to run away from them, but soon recognized: they <u>can</u> hunting you forever shambling right behind you.
There is no good defense against them, their endurance and rage hunger drives them through everything. Moreover, they have basic intelligence to recognize if they cannot break through walls, doors, barricades, there must be a way to your warm flesh somehow - and they'll find it. Fortunately there is an army fort or base somewhere you can hide and your life guaranteed. Let's pack up head to that coordinates you copied out from that radio's jammed noise in static you've just find and made working.

<u>II. "Cover me!" - Dawn of the Dead</u>
You're not alone, you knew it as soon as you've heard something in the radio static. More survivors out there fighting for their life, defending little hideouts they have, protecting their family and friends - at least the living remains of them. Of course they're right on that path you walk to army base. It's time to make new buddies, slow down the horde of undeads a bit to earn some time for escaping forward to that coordinates. Board up the windows and doors - your made up fort must hold on until the vehicle in garage become ready to hit the road. This is the plan. And plans never working well in this upside down world.

<u>III. "Road to Hell" - Days of the Dead</u>
You've ran away from horror day by day, why would it be different now? The fort have been sieged by zombies, a handful of survivors defending themselves without hope. You came for help - but you are the help now. Let's do the good old routine that never worked. Board up the windows and hold on until find a solution. Is there a solution at all?


The mod's focus mainly on survival, therefore resource gathering is significant, while crafting has lower priority and mining has the lowest. Motto is "Use what you find and make it better with duct tape."
