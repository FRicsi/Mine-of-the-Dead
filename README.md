# No more Mine in Hell
Minecraft mod

The mod based on George A. Romero's artistic work of Living Dead series aka the "Dead Series".
It reflects to and uses basic rules of the world of original movies and the remakes as well. Main concept of the mod is survive a zombie pandemic outbreak, defend yourself while keep focus on the actual goal of the act 1-3. You'll have some weapons, tools and the skill of crafting some items, but basically not much. The world have had its economy that collapsed now, and missing many things to let you craft essential things (like guns). However, you can fix almost everything.
There was electricity, hot water, working cars and factories, gas stations and offices - now its all gone due of dead staff.
Dead, but not as dead as could be acceptable - they are reanimated corpses now hungry for living's brain. Yeah, your's as well.
Wandering in hordes, hunting for prey, they're too many. Fighting is not a clever option, runnung away and hiding could be better. Or couldn't?
It is up to you.

There will be some inevitable similarity with other products (without the need for completeness: Dead Island, State of Decay, Seven Days to Die games, other movies like Zombieland or TWD) due of inspiration effect of Romero's work. Other similarities coming from logical and basic consequence of applying rules and dramaturgy of an imagined zombie-cataclismatic world.
 
The III act are going through the main story line of Night of the Living Dead - Dawn of the Dead - Days of the Dead.

The mod's focus mainly on survival, therefore resource gathering is significant, while crafting has lower priority and mining has the lowest.
